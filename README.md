# MAIN Recruitment

Project containing Java resources for MAIN recruitment

## News Articles

The business would like to perform some analytics on the news articles a users views over the course of a month. One of our developers started work on a RESTful service, but they are off on annual leave for a few weeks.

Your task is to pick up their work and finish the service.

### Pre-requisites

* This project requires [Java 11](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11) to run
* This project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for dependency management

### Tasks

1. Clone the repository and build the code

2. Fix the broken test in ArticleTest

3. Implement a new feature so we can determine the top three categories the user liked the most

_Treat this like your own project, if there are any code smells or things that can be improved call them out_
